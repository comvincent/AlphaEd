# Introduction

> **ALPHA Ed** - is a simple *command line* based modal text editor created in bash. It is simple to use and it is general purpose enough to be used for literally anything that involves writting text. It is forked for bed, and it is also written completely in shell script or bash script.  

 *Alpha Ed is provided for free as it is open source. See licence on the repository page.*

    d  - delete the whole line

#### note 

> The editor is entirely written in shell script, it is slow on some devices as it depends on processes for execution, some processes start slowly.

# Build
> * AlphaEd only depends on sh, which is by default, installed on most Android devices.
> * The editor builds using **c4droid** mobile ide
> * **c4droid** uses the **tcc** *(Tiny c compiler)* compiler for Android. As a result, the output executable has a smaller size
> ### build instructions
>> * Have **c4droid** installed
>> * clone this repository and unzip the folder
>> * open the **Alpha.c** in c4droid 
>> * compile and run
>> * if successful, build apk by exporting.
>> * if fails create an issue and put the resulting error message
